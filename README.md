## Usage
Users are given a Pokemon Quiz. At the Start Quiz Page there are a list of rules. Once the User presses "Start Quiz" they have 60 seconds to complete the quiz. If they get an answer correct the Progress bubble turns green. If they get it incorrect it becomes red. At the end of the Quiz they are given a score and are prompted to enter their initials for the leaderboard.
